## Run it locally

Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   
   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

   This will create a virtual environment named `myenv`.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   
   - On Windows:
   
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:
   
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   
   Navigate to the directory where `requirements.txt` is located and run:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Run the script**:
   
   ```
   streamlit run Chatbot.py
   ```
